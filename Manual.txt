if the application is frozen it means it is doing work! check task manager. Do not close the application and wait patiently. 
Extracting training data takes a lot of time - even hours. Especially if the data is located on a HDD.

if the automatic saving of the model after training is cancelled the model is still kept loaded in the application

Augmentation: 
    take positive data on put a background noise on top of them
    the more the augmentations the better the resulting model
    but at the cost of requiring more resources during extraction and training
    big augmentations may not fit into RAM
